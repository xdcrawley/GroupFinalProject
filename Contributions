Contributions List:

Well so far I haven't been contacted by my partner so far I have done everything from module 1 to module 5 by myself.
I sent a discussion to my GitHub repository while all I needed back was a GitHub username to make it a group repository.
ANyways so far I have done everything from the README file, the Prodcut Development file, and the entire powerpoint.
Although I haven't finished some things such as the datasets(looked through some but haven't settled on which dataset I want to use), the visuals, and the logo.
For this phase in particular I have completed all of these objectives:

Decide what type of AI/ML will be used (e.g., classification, NLP, regression, clustering) • Research datasets — real or simulated • Discuss model limitations and potential risks

• Identify key ethical concerns (bias, fairness, transparency, privacy) • Define target market and user needs • Draft an ethical use statement describing responsible deployment
