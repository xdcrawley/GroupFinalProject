PRODUCT CONCEPT

Name:
EcoRoute AI

Purpose:
EcoRoute AI is an AI-powered route optimization tool designed to help drivers and delivery fleets choose the most fuel-efficient and eco-friendly routes, rather than simply the fastest. The goal is to reduce fuel costs, travel time inefficiencies, and vehicle emissions through intelligent data analysis.

Problem It Solves:
Most navigation systems focus only on minimizing distance or time, ignoring how terrain, traffic, and driving style affect fuel efficiency. As a result, drivers waste fuel and produce unnecessary carbon emissions.
EcoRoute AI solves this by predicting fuel consumption for different route conditions and recommending routes that balance time and energy efficiency.

AI/ML INTEGRATION

EcoRoute AI uses machine learning to analyze trip data and predict route efficiency. The system integrates two main models:

Regression Model (e.g., Random Forest or Linear Regression) – predicts fuel consumption (in liters) based on route features like distance, speed, elevation, traffic, and weather.

Classification Model (e.g., Decision Tree or Logistic Regression) – classifies each trip as Efficient or Inefficient, allowing users to visualize and compare route performance.

Together, these models enable EcoRoute AI to make data-driven recommendations for greener, cost-effective transportation.
