Name: 
Xander Crawley

Assigned Role: 
All Roles

Description of my Contribution and Workload:
Everything. I have done all parts and roles of this project since my project partner has not been able to be contacted and also hasn't responded to my discussions.

Constructive Feedback on Your Team’s Collaboration: 
I don't have any useful feedback since I completed this project by myself. 
If I have to give productive feedback i would say that it would be better if there would be at least 5 members in each time 
while also assigning the members roles themselves instead of letting the people in the team choose themselves 
since I thing it would waste more time than needed.

Any Challenges or Team Dynamics Worth Noting:
My challenges were once again because I completed the project by myself so I had problems with the team dynamics 
and the roles and team in general since I couldn't assign roles to anyone and didn't have any help to start or complete the project.
