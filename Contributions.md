Contributions List:


Well so far, I haven't been contacted by my partner I have done everything from module 1 to module 5 by myself.
I sent a discussion to my GitHub repository while all I needed back was a GitHub username to make it a group repository.
Anyway, so far, I have done everything from the README file, the Product Development file, and the entire PowerPoint. Although I haven't finished some things such as the datasets (looked through some but haven't settled on which dataset I want to use), the visuals, and the logo. For this phase I have completed all these objectives below by myself.

Decide what type of AI/ML will be used (e.g., classification, NLP, regression, clustering), Research datasets whether real or simulated, Discuss model limitations and potential risks

Identify key ethical concerns (bias, fairness, transparency, privacy), Define target market and user needs, Draft an ethical use statement describing responsible deployment

Overall I think I am making good progress in the Final Project and I getting ready to slightly modify the Power Point to make it closer to how the finished product should be such as finally picking a dataset, getting the visuals about said dataset, getting a logo, and then finally trying to cut back on some information to make the Power Point fit into the range of 5-10 slides like it was suggested to be.
