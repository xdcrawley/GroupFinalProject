Product Concept
Name:
EcoRoute AI

Purpose:
EcoRoute AI is an AI-powered route optimization tool designed to help drivers and delivery fleets choose the most fuel-efficient and eco-friendly routes, rather than simply the fastest. The goal is to reduce fuel costs, travel time inefficiencies, and vehicle emissions through intelligent data analysis.

Problem It Solves:
Most navigation systems focus only on minimizing distance or time, ignoring how terrain, traffic, and driving style affect fuel efficiency. As a result, drivers waste fuel and produce unnecessary carbon emissions.
EcoRoute AI solves this by predicting fuel consumption for different route conditions and recommending routes that balance time and energy efficiency.
