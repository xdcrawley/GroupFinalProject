Product Name: QuickRoute AI

Problem Statement: In modern transportation, drivers and delivery fleets often rely on navigation systems that prioritize only the fastest route, not the most efficient one.
This leads to:
• Higher fuel consumption
•	Increased CO₂ emissions
•	Unnecessary costs for individuals and businesses
There is currently no simple, accessible system that helps everyday drivers make eco-friendly route decisions using real-world conditions such as traffic, terrain, and driving         behavior.

How AI Will Address It: QuickRoute AI uses machine learning to analyze and predict the fuel efficiency of different driving routes based on key factors such as:
•	Distance and average speed
•	Elevation or slope of the road
•	Traffic density
•	Weather and temperature

The system’s AI models include:
1.	Regression Model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor or Linear Regression):
Predicts the estimated fuel consumption (liters) for any given route.
2.	Classification Model (e.g., Decision Tree or Logistic Regression):
Categorizes trips as Efficient or Inefficient, helping users understand which routes or driving styles save more energy.
By combining these models, QuickRoute AI can recommend optimized routes that reduce both cost and environmental impact.

Dashboard Output
   - Predicted fuel usage
   - Efficiency rating (Eco/Moderate/Inefficient)
   - Visualization (bar & line charts)

User Interface (Simple Mockup Concept):
•	A clean dashboard showing:
o	“Predicted Fuel Usage: 4.2 liters”
o	“Eco Score: 85/100 (Efficient Route)”
o	A chart comparing predicted vs. actual efficiency
o	Buttons: [Enter Route Data], [View Efficiency Report]

Summary: QuickRoute AI is a smart, data-driven assistant that helps drivers choose eco-friendly routes and improve driving habits. By using AI to predict and classify route efficiency, it aims to reduce fuel costs and promote sustainable transportation choices.

My contributions would be everything so far. I chose the field, topic and everything else since I haven't heard from my partner in this project.
So I am the one who finalized the product idea, wrote a clear problem statement, identified how AI will address it. and sketched the initial product concept or system overview as you can see above.
